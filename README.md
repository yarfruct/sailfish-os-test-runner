# Sailfish OS Test Runner

A tooling to execute tasks on Sailfish and Avrora OS.

The tool provides two main scripts `build-app.rb` and `run-tests.rb`. The first one is used to build the application, the latter one executes the tests.

A description of used approach is described in our paper [Method and tools for automated end-to-end testing of applications for Sailfish OS](https://www.fruct.org/publications/fruct20/files/Vas.pdf)
